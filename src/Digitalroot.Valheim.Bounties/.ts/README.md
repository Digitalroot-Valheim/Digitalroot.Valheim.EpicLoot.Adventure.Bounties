## Information

*Digitalroot's Epic Loot Adventure Bounties

Adds 275+ bounties across all biomes to Epic Loot's Adventure mode.

```WARNING: This mod will remove any bounties added via "adventuredata.json"```

I created this because I didn't want to keep merging my custom bounties in "adventuredata.json" every time
there was a new release. While it removes the default bounties, they are re-added via the mod.

## Bounty Details

  ` Check out the ReadMe﻿ for details on what new bounties are added.
  `  Vanilla
  `  Bears (optional)
  `  MonsterLabZ (optional)
  `  RRRMonster (optional)
  `  Monsternomicon (optional)

## Customize

    In the files is an example mod template that can be used to add even more bounties.
